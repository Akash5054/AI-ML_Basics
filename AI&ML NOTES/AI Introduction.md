# **What is Artificial Intelligence(AI)?
__________________________________________________________________________
- **AI** (**Artificial Intelligence**) is the field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks that normally require **human intelligence** — such as **learning, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions**.
###  **In simple words:**

- **AI** is when a machine can think, learn, and make decisions like a human — or at least act in a smart way to achieve a goal.
### **In simple Analogy:

- **AI** is like teaching a child — you don’t tell them exactly what to do in every possible case, you show them examples, and they learn patterns to apply in new situations.

### **Core idea:

Instead of giving a computer exact step-by-step instructions for everything, AI allows it to:

- **Learn** from data or experience.
- **Adapt** to new situations.
- **Make predictions or decisions** based on patterns.

# **Real world examples of AI :
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Virtual assistants** (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant)
- Uses AI to respond like a human by understanding your voice.

2.**Chat box**
- Uses AI to give the answers for the given prompts.

4.**Self-driving cars**
- Uses AI mechanisms to drive accordingly.

5.**Facial recognition**
- Uses AI to detect the face.

# **Main Types of AI
----------------------------------------------------------------
### Narrow AI**

- Specialized for one task.
- Example: Chess-playing program, Google Translate.

###  **General AI

- Can understand and learn any intellectual task that a human can.
-  Still theoretical — we don’t have it yet.

### **Super Intelligent AI

-  Exceeds human intelligence in every domain.
-  Purely speculative at this point.

# **What are the Techniques AI Uses?
----------------------------------------------------------------
### Machine Learning(ML)

-  ML is a method in AI where machines **learn from data** instead of being explicitly programmed.
- System learn from data (ex-Predicting whether).
### **Deep Learning

- Neural networks that mimic brain structure for complex tasks like image or speech recognition.
- DL uses **neural networks** with many layers (deep networks) to process complex data like images, sound, and text.
### **Natural Language Processing(NLP)

- - Understanding and generating human language.
### **Computer Vision

- Understanding images and voices.
